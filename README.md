Ever dreamed of creating your own interactive story or visual novel, but felt intimidated by complex coding and game engines?

**Hikarin is for you.** It’s a simple, powerful tool designed to help you write, build, and share your stories with the world. Instead of creating a clunky game file, Hikarin transforms your story into a single, universal file that can be played almost anywhere—in a web browser, inside other games, and even in Minecraft.

This project was born from a single, passionate goal: to bring the legendary **Minecraft Mob Talker Mod** back to life, allowing rich, character-driven stories to unfold right inside the game.

## ✨ Why You'll Love Hikarin

*   **Create Once, Play Anywhere:** The magic of Hikarin is that it exports your entire visual novel as a single, portable `story.json` file. If a game or platform can read a simple text file, it can run your story. This means your creation isn't trapped in one place.
*   **Write Your Way:**
    *   **For the Visual Thinker:** Use the beautiful drag-and-drop editor to build your story visually.
    *   **For the Power User:** If you're comfortable with code, you can switch to a text-based editor and write your logic in Python for maximum control.
*   **See Your Story Come to Life Instantly:** No more waiting for your project to compile or load. The built-in preview lets you test your story in real-time, so you can focus on creating, not waiting.
*   **Your All-in-One Studio:** Manage your characters, art, and sound effects from a simple, integrated library. No more digging through folders!

## 🎨 Your Creative Journey

With Hikarin, bringing your story to life is a simple, three-step process:

1.  **Dream & Build:** Write your script and design your story's flow using the visual editor. Add your characters, art, and music.
2.  **Play & Perfect:** Use the instant preview to play through your story again and again, tweaking the dialogue and choices until it's just right.
3.  **Share Your Masterpiece:** Export your finished story as a single file, ready to be shared on the web or loaded into another game.

## ⛏️ The Grand Vision: Bringing Stories to Minecraft

The heart and soul of this project is the **Mob Talker Revival**. We believe that games like Minecraft are incredible sandboxes for storytelling. Hikarin is the key to unlocking that potential.

Here’s how it works:
1.  You create an amazing, interactive story in the easy-to-use Hikarin editor.
2.  You export it as a universal `story.json` file.
3.  Our upcoming Mob Talker mod for Minecraft reads that file, allowing players to interact with characters and experience your visual novel *directly inside the game*.
