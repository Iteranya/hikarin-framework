Turn your story ideas into playable, interactive experiences. **Hikarin** is a simple, powerful tool designed to help you write, build, and share visual novels and interactive stories with the world—no coding required.

Instead of creating a clunky game file, Hikarin transforms your story into a single, universal file that can be played almost anywhere—in a web browser, inside other games, and even in Minecraft.

## ✨ Why You'll Love Hikarin

*   **Create Once, Play Anywhere:** The magic of Hikarin is that it exports your entire visual novel as a single, portable `story.json` file. If a game or platform can read a simple text file, it can run your story. This means your creation isn't trapped in one place.
*   **No Code, All Creativity:** Focus on your story, not on programming. Our intuitive visual block editor makes building complex narratives as simple as connecting the dots.
*   **See Your Story Come to Life Instantly:** No more waiting for your project to compile or load. The built-in preview lets you test your story in real-time, so you can focus on creating, not waiting.
*   **Your All-in-One Studio:** Manage your characters, art, and sound effects from a simple, integrated library. No more digging through folders!
